# Brainstorm: Creative Promotion of Voice Assistant & Intelligent Spaces

## 1. Project Overview
- **Core Concept**: "Cognitive Symphony" - balancing automated voice handling (call center) with spatial data management.
- **Spectrum**: From the "noise" of phone calls to the "intelligence" of data-driven spaces.
- **Key Value**: Enhancing human cognitive capabilities through AI orchestration.
- **Visual Style**: "Cosmic Dark/Neon" - Deep purples, cyans, 3D lighting, and glass textures.

## 2. Narrative Arc (TED Style)
1. **The Burden of Noise**: We start with the mental load of managing a modern business (call center chaos).
2. **The Invisible Assistant**: Introducing the Voice layer that filters chaos into structure.
3. **The Thinking Space**: Moving from voice to space - how data flows through the walls of the company.
4. **Cognitive Harmony**: The result is a business that "thinks" and "responds" without manual friction.

## 3. High-Level Approach
- **Narrative**: Use /superpowers-narrative to build a 10-12 slide deck in Polish.
- **Structure**: Problem -> Solution -> Scale (Voice to Space) -> Future Vision.
- **Visuals**: CSS/HTML based slides using the "Cosmic Dark" palette derived from FlowAssist V2.

## 4. Architectural Option
- **Option A (Story-Driven)**: Focus on a "Day in the Life" of a business owner.
- **Option B (Tech-Driven)**: Focus on the "Thinking Architecture" from Voice AI to Spatial Data.
- **Option C (Synthesis)**: Selected approach - balancing the practical (voice calls) with the futuristic (spatial intel).
